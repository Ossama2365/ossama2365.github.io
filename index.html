<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ossama Osman and as long as I can remember IT has served a large role in my life as a consumer. My family lived in Australia until I was four which was when we moved to the United Arab Emirates. We lived there until we came back to Australia when I was twelve. All through life in the middle east and as well as back home I developed a childhood curiosity for computers and how they operate. I have never had time or the energy to satisfy that curiosity until it came time to decide on a future and a career for myself and my family. Landing on Information Technology felt like as natural a decision as any. I am extremely ignorant about most things IT but there is no doubt that I have a great interest in it and even though I am only three weeks into a course I can tell that interest will sustain me. My own interests have ranged from video games, basketball and geography and in all of those I have been fascinated with the inner workings such as complex basketball sets. This has also extended to video games and computing in general with an interest I hope to sate on how computers function from the ground up.

<h2>My Interest in Information Technology</h2>
<p>IT is a field that harbors so many opportunities and branching paths for a career to travel down.  This is one reason I have decided to study it. I truly believe technology is always a good place to invest yourself given the nature of its everchanging condition. From what I have heard as well as what I have been told, Information Technology is a field in which occupants never stop learning. There will always be new technology adapting the atmosphere and there will always be new technology rendering old ones obsolete. I enjoy learning and keeping up with current affairs, so the perpetual learning process is an aspect that attracts me to this field. My own personal experience within IT is limited, however. All my experience comes from the perspective of a consumer and nothing beyond such as working with the user space of the windows operating system alone. I look forward to expanding my repertoire in this regard and understanding the fundamentals of computing. I am hoping to learn more about programming as well as hardware, these are the two main interests I have within IT. I aspire to begin my career in either sales or a helpdesk role. I have worked in many different industries since I entered the workforce and customer service is by far my favorite industry to work in. I believe in this regard I would have an advantage coming from a customer service background when trying to liaison with customers especially in a helpdesk role. RMIT showed up in my crosshair due to a friend that recommended it. He had previously lived and studied there in Melbourne and recommended the University to me which in turn caused me to investigate the University and to discover I was able to access the course material through Open Universities Australia.
