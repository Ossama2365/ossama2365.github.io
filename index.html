<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ossama Osman and as long as I can remember IT has served a large role in my life as a consumer. My family lived in Australia until I was four which was when we moved to the United Arab Emirates. We lived there until we came back to Australia when I was twelve. All through life in the middle east and as well as back home I developed a childhood curiosity for computers and how they operate. I have never had time or the energy to satisfy that curiosity until it came time to decide on a future and a career for myself and my family. Landing on Information Technology felt like as natural a decision as any. I am extremely ignorant about most things IT but there is no doubt that I have a great interest in it and even though I am only three weeks into a course I can tell that interest will sustain me. My own interests have ranged from video games, basketball and geography and in all of those I have been fascinated with the inner workings such as complex basketball sets. This has also extended to video games and computing in general with an interest I hope to sate on how computers function from the ground up.
