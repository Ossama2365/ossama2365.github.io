<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ossama Osman and as long as I can remember IT has served a large role in my life as a consumer. My family lived in Australia until I was four which was when we moved to the United Arab Emirates. We lived there until we came back to Australia when I was twelve. All through life in the middle east and as well as back home I developed a childhood curiosity for computers and how they operate. I have never had time or the energy to satisfy that curiosity until it came time to decide on a future and a career for myself and my family. Landing on Information Technology felt like as natural a decision as any. I am extremely ignorant about most things IT but there is no doubt that I have a great interest in it and even though I am only three weeks into a course I can tell that interest will sustain me. My own interests have ranged from video games, basketball and geography and in all of those I have been fascinated with the inner workings such as complex basketball sets. This has also extended to video games and computing in general with an interest I hope to sate on how computers function from the ground up.

<h2>My Interest in Information Technology</h2>
<body>IT is a field that harbors so many opportunities and branching paths for a career to travel down.  This is one reason I have decided to study it. I truly believe technology is always a good place to invest yourself given the nature of its everchanging condition. From what I have heard as well as what I have been told, Information Technology is a field in which occupants never stop learning. There will always be new technology adapting the atmosphere and there will always be new technology rendering old ones obsolete. I enjoy learning and keeping up with current affairs, so the perpetual learning process is an aspect that attracts me to this field. My own personal experience within IT is limited, however. All my experience comes from the perspective of a consumer and nothing beyond such as working with the user space of the windows operating system alone. I look forward to expanding my repertoire in this regard and understanding the fundamentals of computing. I am hoping to learn more about programming as well as hardware, these are the two main interests I have within IT. I aspire to begin my career in either sales or a helpdesk role. I have worked in many different industries since I entered the workforce and customer service is by far my favorite industry to work in. I believe in this regard I would have an advantage coming from a customer service background when trying to liaison with customers especially in a helpdesk role. RMIT showed up in my crosshair due to a friend that recommended it. He had previously lived and studied there in Melbourne and recommended the University to me which in turn caused me to investigate the University and to discover I was able to access the course material through Open Universities Australia.

<h3>My Ideal Job</h3>
<body>Based on a good amount of customer service-related roles I have enjoyed in the past I would like to take my experience and expertise with me into my IT career. Given a solid understanding of the IT world I believe I would greatly enjoy a role such as this one. To work directly with customers or clients with tech issues and to solve problems and help people I believe would be a very rewarding experience.
    This role is a desktop and application support position in which they are looking for an applicant to maintain and manage any IT related issues that come forth. They have a very large team at their head office (I used to work for the company and went there for numerous reasons during my tenure) and they require someone to join their small team of Level 2 IT support specialists to oversee their computing operation in house as well as remote support to the numerous chain businesses all over South Australia. I recall the software they used for their POS was very prone to issues so I can see their crucial need for IT staff. This type of role is extremely interesting to me as someone who enjoys working in a team, enjoys helping people and enjoys solving problems. This particular company has been known to aggressively expand so opportunities for consultation and computing setup in the various stores is very likely an additional duty that would present itself from time to time.
    For this position they require tertiary qualifications or adequate experience in a similar role. They find knowledge in the Microsoft programs such as Outlook, PowerPoint, Word etc. to be very advantageous as well as knowledge of cloud computing. They expect basic knowledge of IP networking and printer setups.
    I have a relatively firm grasp on most of the Office suit of programs however I fall short on all the other particulars.
    My plan is to reach beyond an area of basic competency in these aspects to thrive in a position such as this one. Of most of those requirements, I hope to achieve them within the material of this course. As of now I am unsure on how I would go about achieving a great understanding of printer setups and how they work outside of the software that governs it. There are a few resources available online that would help get me there such as this one. 
    I am also unsure of whether this would classify as an entry level position or not. The option between relevant experience or tertiary education tells me that knowledge of these languages and software could potentially mark one as a successful candidate. If that is true than I may find myself applying for a job such as this with just a couple of years of this bachelor under my belt.
