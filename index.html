<h1>About Me</h1>
<section>My name is Ossama Osman and as long as I can remember IT has served a large role in my life as a consumer. My family lived in Australia until I was four which was when we moved to the United Arab Emirates. We lived there until we came back to Australia when I was twelve. All through life in the middle east and as well as back home I developed a childhood curiosity for computers and how they operate. I have never had time or the energy to satisfy that curiosity until it came time to decide on a future and a career for myself and my family. Landing on Information Technology felt like as natural a decision as any. I am extremely ignorant about most things IT but there is no doubt that I have a great interest in it and even though I am only three weeks into a course I can tell that interest will sustain me. My own interests have ranged from video games, basketball and geography and in all of those I have been fascinated with the inner workings such as complex basketball sets. This has also extended to video games and computing in general with an interest I hope to sate on how computers function from the ground up.
</section>
<h2>My Interest in Information Technology</h2>
<section>IT is a field that harbors so many opportunities and branching paths for a career to travel down.  This is one reason I have decided to study it. I truly believe technology is always a good place to invest yourself given the nature of its everchanging condition. From what I have heard as well as what I have been told, Information Technology is a field in which occupants never stop learning. There will always be new technology adapting the atmosphere and there will always be new technology rendering old ones obsolete. I enjoy learning and keeping up with current affairs, so the perpetual learning process is an aspect that attracts me to this field. My own personal experience within IT is limited, however. All my experience comes from the perspective of a consumer and nothing beyond such as working with the user space of the windows operating system alone. I look forward to expanding my repertoire in this regard and understanding the fundamentals of computing. I am hoping to learn more about programming as well as hardware, these are the two main interests I have within IT. I aspire to begin my career in either sales or a helpdesk role. I have worked in many different industries since I entered the workforce and customer service is by far my favorite industry to work in. I believe in this regard I would have an advantage coming from a customer service background when trying to liaison with customers especially in a helpdesk role. RMIT showed up in my crosshair due to a friend that recommended it. He had previously lived and studied there in Melbourne and recommended the University to me which in turn caused me to investigate the University and to discover I was able to access the course material through Open Universities Australia.

<h3>My Ideal Job</h3>
<section>Based on a good amount of customer service-related roles I have enjoyed in the past I would like to take my experience and expertise with me into my IT career. Given a solid understanding of the IT world I believe I would greatly enjoy a role such as this one. To work directly with customers or clients with tech issues and to solve problems and help people I believe would be a very rewarding experience.
    This role is a desktop and application support position in which they are looking for an applicant to maintain and manage any IT related issues that come forth. They have a very large team at their head office (I used to work for the company and went there for numerous reasons during my tenure) and they require someone to join their small team of Level 2 IT support specialists to oversee their computing operation in house as well as remote support to the numerous chain businesses all over South Australia. I recall the software they used for their POS was very prone to issues so I can see their crucial need for IT staff. This type of role is extremely interesting to me as someone who enjoys working in a team, enjoys helping people and enjoys solving problems. This particular company has been known to aggressively expand so opportunities for consultation and computing setup in the various stores is very likely an additional duty that would present itself from time to time.
    For this position they require tertiary qualifications or adequate experience in a similar role. They find knowledge in the Microsoft programs such as Outlook, PowerPoint, Word etc. to be very advantageous as well as knowledge of cloud computing. They expect basic knowledge of IP networking and printer setups.
    I have a relatively firm grasp on most of the Office suit of programs however I fall short on all the other particulars.
    My plan is to reach beyond an area of basic competency in these aspects to thrive in a position such as this one. Of most of those requirements, I hope to achieve them within the material of this course. As of now I am unsure on how I would go about achieving a great understanding of printer setups and how they work outside of the software that governs it. There are a few resources available online that would help get me there such as this one. 
    I am also unsure of whether this would classify as an entry level position or not. The option between relevant experience or tertiary education tells me that knowledge of these languages and software could potentially mark one as a successful candidate. If that is true than I may find myself applying for a job such as this with just a couple of years of this bachelor under my belt.

<h4>Personal Profile</h4>    
<section>At the completion of the Myers-Briggs personality test I was identified as an ENFP personality type. This was no surprise to me as I have done this test, however on a different website, before in the past and was familiar with all of the 16 personality types. I also completed a learning style test as well as the ‘Big 5 Personality’ test.
    This result and subsequent information detailing the personality type falls in line with my own understanding of myself. Such as my proclivity to think abstractly or to often focus more on feeling rather than logic. This aspect of my personality is likely what served me well in customer service roles in the past. However, I understand the validity of the Myers-Briggs personality type theory has been questioned by many and so I don’t take the results too literally. From experience in working as part of a team, my extraversion and feeling first tendencies have helped me foster a positive and welcoming environment however not necessarily always a productive one. This has been a process I have tried to change in the past about my ability to be a productive member of a team, to varied success.
    My result in the learning style test however took me by complete surprise, indicating that I scored 45% as an auditory learner, 35% tactile and 20% visual. I was expecting to score much higher in visual learning with the majority being tactile. I am not sure what led me to think of my own learning properties as such but in learning of the reality it makes sense to me. I very often understand things through speaking them and I tend to recite mathematical equations in my head rather than visualizing them. I also get distracted by background noise very easily and struggle to focus in anything less than complete silence. Learning of my auditory advantage I plan on utilizing it with new study strategies and new ways to take in information. This test has been extremely useful for me and I am glad it has been included as part of the curriculum.
    
    Keeping this in mind is something I strive to achieve as I move closer to my first group project of the course. A comfortable social environment is important as is the equal workload and symmetry of a team and I hope to foster such an environment in the projects forthcoming. Providing plenty of opportunities to discuss the course material or assessment material within the groups will prove extremely useful to someone as a predominantly auditory learner such as myself. This is a strategy I plan on bringing with me into assessment 2 and beyond.
    The ‘Big 5’ personality test also provided me with useful information to carry forth with. I scored extremely high in trait Openness and extremely low in Conscientiousness which indicates a mix of positives and negatives to my personality as a team player. Openness governs the ability to think laterally and creatively to solve complex problems however leaves you wanting in the concentration and day to day determination department. Individuals high in Openness tend to be easily sidetracked, too caught up in the big picture, impulsive and can be unreliable in pursuit of a long-term goal. Simply being aware of something is usually the first step in solving an issue, therefore the knowing of potential pitfalls and traps can help someone remain productive in the face of their own trait disadvantage. Embracing effective means to maintain self-motivation will be my own way of mitigating this.

 <h5>Project Idea</h5>  
 <section>As a major fan of basketball and a practitioner of frequent backyard basketball games, there is certainly room for an exciting and innovative IT creation to step forward. A product that is able to act as a customizable at-home scoreboard for all aspiring hoopers to utilize. I have seen a few at-home scoreboards on the market today that offer the ability to keep track of scores, time or fouls at the press of a button on a small device, usually fixed onto the basketball pole. This project idea is for a much larger scoreboard with multiple features that is fixed onto the back of any see-through backboard. This would not have been possible a few years ago as plastic backboards were quite common on portable basketball systems. Today the trend has shifted heavily toward a polycarbonate or glass backboard as it allows for much sturdier rebounding which better simulates a professional or amateur basketball setup. This scoreboard would be customizable through a companion application. You would be able to change details such as team names, points per bucket, points required to win, time limit and the interface in which these details are displayed. Operation of the scoreboard during active play would be through speech recognition. Through speech the device would have as little burden on the players and disruption of play as possible. Simply announcing the points, fouls or re-matching would make for quick uninterrupted basketball which is what no other at-home scoreboard currently offers. This device would also be located within the most natural location for basketball players to be looking at, the rim. The scoreboard would also have in built speakers to play sound effects intrinsic in the score board’s functionality. For instance, at the conversion of a basket and the subsequent call of “2 points B” (Team B) for the software, a sound prompt will activate to indicate the reception of the call out. This will ensure the scores are accurately recorded and maintained. 
    Of course, there are plenty of potential concerns. Many different backboards come in different shapes and sizes and while this device would look seamless on some systems it may be partially blocked or may not fit on some backboards at all. There is also the aforementioned community of plastic, colored or opaque backboards that are incompatible. Although they are certainly the minority of basketball systems, they do still render this invention useless. Working with speech recognition software can be tricky and could pose a threat to the effectiveness of this device however the companion app will also have the ability to record the same data that may need to be manually inputted thus significantly reducing the usefulness, originality or effectiveness of the device. There is also the question of sturdiness given the dunking that could often occur. A lot of individuals get at-home basketball systems to lower the rim and live out their dream of dunking, so the sturdiness of the system could dictate the wellbeing of the scoreboard.
    A similar device has been created which offers a portable scoreboard to be placed anywhere and is purely controlled by a companion application. Meaning a third party will be required to make use of it unless active play is to be halted after every basket which is not ideal. It is clearly designed to accompany pick-up games and offer a variety of features that can support such an environment such as a mic port, internal speakers to connect smartphones to and it can even act as an amplifier for musical instruments. As far as my research tells me this would be the biggest competitor to my projected idea beside the archaic digital clocks and portable score counting devices of the past.
    As mentioned above the scoreboard’s main utility is as a display for information. That information would be inputted through speech recognition software available on the companion app and then displayed through the scoreboard. The scoreboard itself may require technology such as a Raspberry Pi to support the processes intrinsic in the scoreboard. The apps functionality would ideally include as many customizations as possible such as background color, font, font color and perhaps themes. Accurate speech recognition software would be the most important aspect of this project to successfully acquire.
    With the completion of this project we would most likely see the most modern, hands-off, and intuitive at-home scoreboard on the market. The successful operation of the speech recognition software would allow players to never have to keep score. It would also prosper the use of timed games which, today, is not a very common way of playing backyard basketball due to its inconvenient nature. Having a scoreboard front and center with little set-up required would foster an otherwise inconvenient game mode. Timed games would also instill a sense of urgent competitiveness as time whittled down to the final minute, similar to the intenseness that often follows a player reaching match point. A product like this could become a staple of convenience to almost all aspiring recreational basketball players and could eliminate one more distraction to allow ballers, to just ball.
